        <h1>About the Muffin vs Chihuahua Classifier</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to the Muffin vs Chihuahua Image Classifier! This web app uses a machine learning model that was trained from scratch to classify images into two categories: Chihuahua or Muffin. The project integrates several cutting-edge technologies to ensure robust performance and easy deployment.
        </p>

        <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Docker:</strong> Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent behavior across development, staging, and production environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Terraform:</strong> Terraform is used to manage the infrastructure as code, automating the deployment of the app to Azure with scalability and reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Django:</strong> The backend of the application is powered by Django, a robust web framework that handles routing, image uploads, and prediction requests.</li>
            <li><strong>TensorFlow:</strong> The machine learning model is built using TensorFlow, trained from scratch to distinguish between images of Chihuahuas and muffins.</li>
            <li><strong>Azure:</strong> The app is deployed on Azure using Azure App Service and Azure Container Registry, offering a scalable and reliable platform for hosting the classifier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works:</h2>
        <p>
            Users upload an image, and the trained TensorFlow model predicts whether the image contains a Chihuahua or a muffin. The result is then displayed along with the uploaded image for comparison.
